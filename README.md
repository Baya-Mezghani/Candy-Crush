# 🍬 Candy-Crush

This project is a simplified clone of the popular game **Candy Crush**, developed in **Java**. It simulates the core mechanics of the original game including matching, scoring, special candies, and cascading effects, all presented through a graphical interface.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The player interacts with a 2D grid of candies and must match **three or more candies of the same type** by swapping adjacent ones. Only moves that result in valid combinations are allowed. The goal is to reach a target score within a limited number of moves.

### 🧩 Match Types and Special Effects

- **3 candies** (line/column): simple match – candies disappear
- **4 candies**: creates a **striped candy** that clears a full row or column
- **5 candies in a T or L shape**: creates an **explosive candy** that clears a 3x3 area
- **5 candies in a straight line**: creates a **color bomb** that removes all candies of a certain type

## ✨ Features

- Object-oriented implementation of game logic
- Detection and handling of valid swaps and combinations
- Candy refill with cascading effects
- Generation and activation of special candies
- Score tracking and win/lose conditions
- Full **JavaFX-based GUI**
